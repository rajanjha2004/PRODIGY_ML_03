Task Overview:
The task is to classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs which are preprocessed, normalized, and used to train the model. The objective is to predict whether a given image is of a cat or a dog.

Steps Taken to Satisfy the Task:

1. Loading and Preprocessing the Data:
--> The dataset folder consists of cats and dogs images, which are loaded using the OpenCV library.
--> All images are resized to 32x32 pixels for faster processing.
--> The images are normalized (pixel values scaled between 0 and 1) to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
--> The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2. Flattening the Image Data:
Since the images are 3D (32x32x3), they are flattened into a single vector (3072 features) for each image, making them compatible with the SVM model.

3. Feature Scaling:
Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler to normalize the data for better performance of the SVM.

4. Model Training:
An SVM model with an RBF kernel (Radial Basis Function) is used to classify the images. This kernel helps handle the non-linear decision boundary between cats and dogs.

5. Model Evaluation:
--> The model is evaluated using the accuracy score and confusion matrix to understand its performance on the test set.
--> The confusion matrix shows how many cats and dogs were correctly classified, and how many were misclassified.

6. Prediction on a New Image:
A function predict_image() is created to predict whether a given test image is a cat or a dog. The test image is resized and scaled before being passed to the model for prediction.

7. Steps to Run the Project:
Dataset Setup:
Make sure the dataset folder dogs_vs_cats/ is structured as follows:

dogs_vs_cats/
├── train/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
└── test/
    ├── cats/
    └── dogs/

The train folder contains images of cats and dogs for training, and the test folder contains images for prediction.

8. Dependencies:
Install the required libraries:
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

9. Run the Script:
Simply run the Python script in your VS Code or terminal. The script will:
--> Load and preprocess the images.
--> Train the SVM model.
--> Print the accuracy of the model on the test set.
--> Show the confusion matrix.
--> Predict whether a given test image is a cat or a dog.

Conclusion:
This project successfully classifies images of cats and dogs using an SVM model with an RBF kernel. The steps include image loading, preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix, and it can predict new images as either a cat or a dog. The project demonstrates the utility of Support Vector Machines in image classification tasks.
